# AWS Interview Questions and Answers (Detailed)

Below is a collection of 50 common AWS interview questions. Each answer includes an in-depth explanation, small code snippets, and diagrams to illustrate the concepts. These examples emphasize how AWS services store data in memory and scale efficiently.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. What is Amazon EC2 and how do you launch an instance?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch an instance using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. A typical CLI command is:
```sh
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
```
EC2 instances can be auto-scaled and placed in different availability zones for resilience.

### 2. How does Amazon S3 ensure durability?
Amazon S3 stores objects redundantly across multiple devices in a region. The service achieves 11 nines of durability by replicating data and using techniques like erasure coding. Versioning and cross-region replication further protect data.

### 3. Explain IAM roles versus IAM users.
IAM users represent individual people or services. IAM roles are temporary credentials that can be assumed by users or AWS services. They are ideal for granting permissions without sharing long-term keys, which reduces security risks.

### 4. How can you encrypt data at rest in S3?
Use server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Client-side encryption is also possible before uploading files. The following diagram shows client-side encryption:
```
+--------+    encrypt   +--------+    upload   +------+
| Client | -----------> | Cipher | ---------> |  S3  |
+--------+             +--------+             +------+
```

### 5. What is AWS Lambda and how does it work with API Gateway?
AWS Lambda runs code in response to triggers. API Gateway can invoke Lambda functions to implement serverless APIs. Memory allocation for a function directly affects performance, as more memory provides higher CPU power. Example configuration with the AWS CLI:
```sh
aws lambda create-function --function-name MyFunc --runtime python3.9 \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/my-role --handler app.lambda_handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip --memory-size 256
```

### 6. Describe VPC subnets and route tables.
A Virtual Private Cloud is divided into subnets across availability zones. Route tables control traffic flow. Public subnets route outbound traffic through an internet gateway, while private subnets use NAT gateways or remain isolated.

### 7. What is Auto Scaling and how is it configured?
Auto Scaling maintains the ideal number of instances based on scaling policies. You define a launch template and create an Auto Scaling group. Scaling policies trigger adjustments using CloudWatch alarms. Instances can scale horizontally to handle load while optimizing cost.

### 8. How do Amazon RDS snapshots help with backup and restore?
RDS snapshots capture a point-in-time state of a database and are stored in S3. Automated backups allow recovery to any second within the retention period. Manual snapshots can be shared across accounts or used to create a new DB instance.

### 9. Explain CloudWatch metrics and alarms.
CloudWatch collects metrics from AWS services and custom applications. You can create alarms that send notifications via SNS or perform actions like Auto Scaling when thresholds are breached. Dashboards provide visual monitoring of system health.

### 10. What is AWS CloudFormation used for?
