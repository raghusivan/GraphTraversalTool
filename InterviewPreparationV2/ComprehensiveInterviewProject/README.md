# Comprehensive Interview Project

This project consolidates all interview preparation material from across the repository.
It includes STAR-formatted answers, detailed guides, and expanded topic files.

- **STAR**: Short answers using the Situation-Task-Action-Result format
- **Detailed**: Extended explanations with diagrams and code snippets
- **Expanded**: Complete question lists from `JDInterviewProject` and `JDInterviewProject_Expanded` along with supplementary guides

Use these resources to prepare for discussions covering Angular, Java, databases, CI/CD, AWS, Infrastructure as Code, and more.
